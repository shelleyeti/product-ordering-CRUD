# Product Ordering

Your task is to simulate a product listing page like you would find on Etsy, Amazon, or Ebay. This application should implement the following features.

1. Display an individual product component. Each product should have a title, short description, price, quantity, and an image.
1. Display the application information in a navigation bar at the top of the page.
    - The name of the company - Betsy
    - Three links: 
        - Categories, 
        - Orders, and 
        - Log Out (_these links won't actually do anything, you're just practicing making the navigation bar a component)
1. Display a review list component that contains a maximum of 3 product review components beneath a product.
